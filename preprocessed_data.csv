Identify risk factors,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/Identify_Risk_Factors_CB.mp4,"A woman is at a risk of getting an infection inside her uterus after her water's have broken especially if more than 18 hours passes before she has a baby. She can also get an infection from frequent vaginal exams. Limit vaginal exams to every four hours during labor or only as necessary. Suspect a uterine infection if a woman has a fever thirty eight degrees centigrade or above and uterine tenderness. She may also have chills, foul smelling fluid from the vagina, a fast pulse over one hundred and her baby's heart rate may also be too high - more than 160 beats per minute. Remember that a woman can also have a fever due to other infections such as pneumonia, malaria or a kidney infection. Risk of abnormal heart rate: Every time you listen to the baby's heart decide whether the rate is normal or not. A baby who's heart rate is slower than 120 or faster than 160 for more than ten minutes maybe in trouble.

Measure temperature,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/how_to_measure_temperature.mp4,"Here's how to determine the baby's temperature. infant temperature, baby temperature, thermometer, cold, hypothermia, fever, hyperthermia, measure temperature, tactile temperature. If you don't have a thermometer, compare the temperature of baby's trunk with your own body temperature using the back of your hands. Feel his feet. The baby's temperature should be similar to yours. As a rough guide, if the feet are warm the baby is warm. If the feet are cold, and the trunk is warm the baby is cold and needs to be warmed right away. If the feet and the trunk are cold, the baby is very cold maybe even quite sick and needs urgent warming and care. To check the temperature using a thermometer, shake it down. Read it to be sure it's below thirty five degrees centigrade. In very hot regions, the thermometer will read higher than a fever if you forget to shake it down. Place it deep under the arm and hold the baby's arm against it's body. Wait three minutes and read the number at the top of the line. Some thermometers will need to be rolled before you see the line. To use a digital thermometer, turn it on and place it deep under the arm. When it beeps, read the temperature in the little window. The normal temperature is between 36.5 to 37.5 centigrade. The baby is too warm if the temperature is above 37.5 and too cold if it is 36.5.

An accurate weight is important for calculating drug doses and to monitor the baby's weight. But it's also important to keep the baby warm while you weigh him, here's how. First place the baby's cloth on the scale pan, set the scale to zero to include the weight of the blanket you are wrapping him, completely undress the baby, wrap him snugly in the cloth to keep him warm and to reduce his movements. Place him on the scale but balance only when the baby and the pan are not moving. Record the weight. Normal birth weight is from 2.5 to 4 kilos, low birth weight is below 2.5 kilos and very low birth weight is less than 1.5 kilos. Low birth weight babies need special care and possibly referral to a higher level facility.

Examine the baby,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/Examine_the_Baby_CB.mp4,"The baby's exam is best done on the first day of life. The health worker carefully examines the baby's body systems for signs of health and normal function as well as for illness or birth defects. This video would demonstrate the exam in three parts - observation, vital signs and the head to toe exam. Ask the mother if shed had any problems during her pregnancy or birth. Ask what she has observed about the baby. Explain to her that you are going to examine the baby to be sure he is healthy. Tell the mother what you are looking for and give positive feedback as you come across normal findings. First wash your hands, then clean the thermometer and stethoscope with antiseptic. Keep the baby warm during the exam. In a warm room, under a lamp or in the mother's lap. Observe the baby, look at his color, his tongue and lips are pink. Inspect his skin. A bluish area on the trunk is normal. Check for jaundice by pressing the skin on the forehead or nose, look for a yellow discoloration best seen in natural light. Check for pallor, a sign of anemia by comparing whiteness on the baby's palm with your palm. The baby's arms and legs are flexed and moving showing that his muscle tone and activity are normal. Check the hands and feet for extra digits. If there is no bone inside, tying a tag will eventually allow it to fall off. Count the baby's breath for a full minute when she is calm. Breathing is normally irregular, the rate should be thirty to sixty breaths per minute. Here is an example of baby breathing too fast with chest indrawing. Nasal flaring can be seen in some babies with breathing problems. Count his heart rate for a full minute with a stethoscope, the rate should be between one hundred and one hundred sixty beats per minute. Now, examine the baby from head to toe. Check the fontanelles on the baby's head. The anterior is here and the posterior is back here. They are normally flat but they swell a little when the baby cries. It's normal to have an uneven shape of the head due to molding from the pressure from the birth canal. It usually goes away by two or three days after birth. Check the baby's eyes for discharge and abnormalities. This baby's eyes are clear. Occasionally we see a spot of blood on the white of the eye due to the trauma of birth. This would go away without treatment. If the pupils are white the baby will be need to be seen by an eye specialist. With a gloved hand, insert your finger tip into the baby's mouth to check his suckling. Ask the mother if the baby has breastfed and whether he sucked well. A baby born with a cleft lip and palette won't be able to suck and will need an alternative feeding method. Its normal for both girls and boys to have swollen breast at birth from the mother's hormones. Gently press his abdomen to feel for softness. A swollen belly can be a sign of obstruction or infection. Notice that the cord is tied well. Some baby's are born with an umbilical hernia, as abdominal muscles mature hernia usually goes away by itself. Turn him gently over and run your finger down the spine to check for openings or defects. This baby has a large spinal defect and will need surgery. The anus is checked by the passage of the first stool. If no stool is passed within twenty four hours, the baby may have a blockage and will need referral. This baby was born with a closed anus that will require surgery. Look at the genitals. In males, you look for the urethra to open at the end of the penis. Feel gently for the two testes in scrotal sac, sometimes they have not yet dropped into the sac. Females can have a white vaginal discharge and even a slight bloody discharge several days after birth. Reassure the mother that she has a perfectly healthy baby.

One way to count is by feelin the rise of the breaths with your hand on the abdomen or count by watching the number of rises. Hold a time piece in view, count the number of times abdomen rises in over one minute. It's important to count the breaths over a full minute because a baby's breathing is naturally irregular. He may stop for a few seconds and then breath fast. Count the breaths only when the baby is resting quietly. A normal rate is thirty to sixty breaths per minute. If you count more than sixty breaths count again to see if the fast breathing continues. If he's breathing more than sixty breaths per minute on the second count he's breathing too fast and will need special care.

Provide cord care,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/Provide_Cord_Care_CB_A.mp4,"The umbilical cord is an entry point for dangerous infection, including tetanus. Infection can easily pass through the cord into the baby's body leading to sepsis and death. The fresh cord stump can also bleed into if not tightly tied or clamped. Do not put anything on the cord stump unless advised by your country's practice. Let it dry open to air. Along with other newborn assessments, check the cord for bleeding every 30 minutes to 1 hour for at least 6 hours. Bleeding from the cord stump can be rapidly fatal. Here the tie is placed too close to the baby's belly. There are only two knots and the second knot is loose. Because the cord is cut too close to the baby's belly and the knot is loose, the cord stump starts to bleed. Re-tie or clamp the cord if you see any bleeding. This baby's cord has been slowly losing blood. There is shock due to severe blood loss. He has rapid breathing, pale lips and pale inner eyelids. Prevent these emergencies by securing the cord well. Over the next few days, the cord stump dries out, changing from light to dark yellow to brown to black and then falls off. The wound heals in one to two weeks. Advise the mother and her family to wash their hands before and after caring for the cord. Immersing the baby during a bath is safe for the cord. If the cord does get soiled, wash it with clean water and soap. Dry it thoroughly. Keep cloth folded below the stump. In many cultures it is common to cover the cord binding the baby's abdomen with a cloth. This practice should be avoided. It can delay drying of the cord and increase the chance of infection. Instead, advise the family to keep it open to air or loosely covered with the baby's clothes. Some babies are born with an umbilical hernia. Binding is not helpful. The hernia will usually go away by itself as the baby grows. In many cultures there are deeply rooted beliefs to apply some kind of substance to the cord stump despite the recommendation to apply nothing. This is dangerous as the substances can be contaminated with germs that may lead to infection. Dung is a particularly dangerous source for tetanus.

Classify the baby,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/Classify_the_Baby_CB.mp4,"Classify whether he is well or unwell within 90 minutes after birth. Classification is based on the baby's exam, temperature and and weight. A well small baby weighs between 1500 to 2500 grams. He maintains a normal temperature with skin to skin contact. He breathes comfortably with a normal rate between 30 and 60 breaths per minute. The baby is able to breastfeed or drink expressed milk with a spoon. These babies can be managed at a lower level health facility. The unwell small baby weighs less than 1500 grams or develops a danger sign. The danger signs are fast breathing, chest in drawing, a temperature that is too low or too high, no movement and convulsions. You can delay classifying the baby as well or unwell for up to 4 hours if the baby is improving over time with your interventions. For example, this baby had fast breathing and improved over time. This baby had a low temperature, then was warmed with extra blankets and within a short time his temperature had risen to the normal range. This baby appears to have poor feeding but feeds well by spoon. Well small babies tire easily and often do not breastfeed initially. Babies that are changing and getting worse need immediate action. This baby appeared well at birth and became unwell later, developing long pauses in his breathing and chest in drawing. He required a speedy transfer to a higher level of care.

Breastfeeding attachement,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/Breastfeeding_Attachment_CB.mp4,"Hold the baby in a way that makes him feel secure and helps him feed most easily. Have the mother bring her baby to her, holding him close, facing and touching her body. The baby's neck should be straight, not twisted and the ear, shoulder and hip should be in line. This will make swallowing easier. Many mothers aim the nipple in the middle of the baby's mouth. This is not ideal because the nipple will end up just inside pressed against the hard roof of the mouth which is painful and doesn't let the baby feed as well. Instead, align the baby's nose to the nipple. Be patient. Wait for the baby to open his mouth very wide like a yawn. Then bring him quickly onto the breast leading with his chin. A gentle push from behind the shoulders as the baby takes the breast can deepen the attachment. The baby is drinking well and breastfeeding is comfortable for the mother. In the second example, as the baby opens very wide, his lower lip is at the base of the areola and the nipple is aimed at the top of his mouth. The baby is attached deeply and drinking well. Large round breasts can present challenges to deep attachment in young babies. Shaping the breast so it most easily fits into the angle of the baby's mouth can help the baby attach well. Mothers are often worried the baby cannot breathe while feeding. Reassure her that baby's noses are designed for breathing when their nose is in the breast. Also show her how to pull her baby closer to move his nose away from the breast. How do we tell if the baby is well attached? The baby's mouth should be wide open. More areola is seen above the baby's mouth than below. The baby's chin is touching the breast and the nose is free. The lower lip is turned outward though in a well attached baby it is usually hidden in the breast. In contrast, this baby has a shallow attachment. She is brought on with a nipple scented in her mouth. The mouth is barely open. An equal amount of areola is seen above and below the mouth. Her chin is off the breast while her lower lip is turned out, which is a good sign. Her cheeks dimple as she sucks, a sign of shallow attachment. If the baby is not well attached, gently take the baby off the breast by putting a clean finger in the corner of her mouth to break the suction. Notice the nipple is pointed from being pinched. Assure mothers that with time and practice, attaching the baby well will get easier and more automatic. By four to six weeks, the baby's head and neck control also helps them to deepen attachment on their own. Look to see if the baby is drinking well. The baby's jaw will drop distinctly as he swallows. The baby who is not getting much milk will have a continuous fast sucking pattern without pauses. Ask the mother how it feels. Breastfeeding should be comfortable except for temporary tenderness in the first few days. She should not feel pinching, pulling or rubbing on her nipple. If it is painful, the baby is probably not well attached. Shallow attachment can lead to less and less milk being produced by the breasts. At this point, worried mothers often start to give their babies other food. As the baby fills up on other food, he wont need as much from the breast. As she sucks less and less, the mothers milk supply will decrease. Breast milk is the best nutrition for the baby. Be sure every mother in your care learns how to attach her baby well to her breast. This will lead to good sucking and plenty of breast milk and no need to give the baby any other food in the first six months of life.

Breastfeeding positions,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/Breastfeeding_Positions_CB_B.mp4,"Now we'll demonstrate some common positions a mother can try. The recline position can continue from birth. The mother leans back, she's upright enough to have eye contact with her baby but leaning far enough back that her whole baby's body rests securely against her. A mother's chest is the special comfort zone for her baby, especially held skin to skin. This closeness helps calm the baby and stimulates his feeding instincts. He will often find his way to the nipple but its also fine to guide the baby. Be patient. As the baby settles, it may take a few minutes to find the nipple and attach. This is a comfortable way for many mothers to breastfeed and can be easy for babies to attach deeply, particularly during the early days and weeks. After a cesarean birth, the baby can be positioned across the mother's chest away from her incision.
The next position is often called the cross cradle hold. This position helps to support the baby's body and is a good one for a mother first learning to breastfeed. The mother holds the baby close to her bringing his bottom tight to her chest with her elbow and supporting his head by placing her thumb and fingers around his neck and an open hand under his head. The baby's weight is supported by her forearm. His nose is positioned opposite the nipple. The baby's head is free to tip back naturally as he attaches to the breast. Hugging the baby in tight improves the attachment. Here the mother holds the baby close to her supported by her arm. Her hand supports the baby's neck and head. The finger is moved to keep the baby's head free to tilt back. This position is also helpful when feeding small or sick babies. The third position is often called the cradle hold. This position is most familiar but gives the mother less control over her baby's head. The mother holds the baby in her arm with his head just below the bend in her elbow and her hand supporting his bottom. She moves the baby over until he faces the breast and his nose is opposite the nipple. Hugging the baby in tight improves the attachment. Straightening the baby's body and hugging her close to the mother improves this position. The underarm hold is next. In this position the baby is well supported and easily positioned. The mothers thumb and fingers are around the baby's neck supporting his head. She positions the baby beside her tucked under her arm. She pushes the baby's bottom against her side. Her arm supports his weight with the baby's face towards her breast and his nose opposite the nipple. The mother brings him to her breast with a quick arm movement. This position gives the mother a good view of her baby's attachment. The mother positions her baby along her side. Putting a blanket or cushion under the baby can be more comfortable. Moving the baby's legs further to the back improves the attachment. This position can be helpful for mothers with large breasts after a caesarean birth and for babies having difficulty attaching deeply. And last is the side lying position. Lying on her side helps a mother to rest. She positions her baby so he's facing her with his nose level with the nipple. She pulls the baby close with her hand on his back. The baby faces the breast. His head is free to tilt back. The mother's hand on his upper back pulls him in close. This is a good position just after giving birth, at night and after a caesarean delivery.

Breast engorgement,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/Breast_Engorgement_CB.mp4,"Breasts that are too full of milk are engorged. It often happens when the milk first comes in a few days after birth. It also happens if the baby hasn't been feeding often enough or is not well attached and doesn't empty the breast. Both breasts will feel very full, hard and tender. First observe whether the baby is well attached. If not, help the mother to learn to attach the baby better. Then explain to the mother how to reduce breast engorgement. Here are six suggestions. First, just before she breastfeeds the mother can put warm, wet, clean cloth on her breasts for a few minutes to help the milk flow. Second, gentle press massage is also helpful. Move fingers in circular motion around the breasts. Third, she can hand express a small amount of milk to make it easier for her baby to attach. Fourth, she should breastfeed often at least every one to two hours. The first breast should be emptied before offering the other breast to the baby. Fifth, repositioning her baby allows all parts of the breast to empty. And last she can express milk after feeding until her breasts feel softer and more comfortable.

Sore or cracked nipples,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/Sore_or_Cracked_Nipples_CB.mp4,"Painful nipples are usually caused by a baby who is not well attached at the breast. This can be prevented by early attachment in the first hours after birth. When the baby is given the time to find the breast on her own, this will often result in good attachment. To prevent painful nipples, be sure all mothers in your care can attach their babies well before leaving for home. If nipple pain does start, help the mother as soon as possible. First observe her breastfeeding. Here we see that the baby's mouth is not wide open. She is taking only the nipple. The mother's fingers prevent the baby from taking more breast. The baby slips off the nipple easily and the mother feels pain. Guide the mother to remove her baby from the breast by placing a finger in a corner of the baby's mouth. Notice the shape of the nipple. A nipple that has been pinched against the hard roof of the baby's mouth will appear pointed instead of round. Explain to the mother that the tongue action of the baby rubs on her nipple and pinches it against the hard palate. This leads to sore and damaged nipples. The key to comfortable breastfeeding is for the baby to attach deeply on the breast. Taking a big mouthful of breast positions the nipple further back in the baby's mouth. Here the nipple will be comfortable in contrast to the nipple in a shallow attachment which is pinched against the hard roof of the mouth. The baby will also get plenty of milk. Help the mother to attach her baby more deeply. Have her hold her baby close facing her breast with the baby's body straight. She positions her baby's nose opposite her nipple. The baby will open her mouth when she smells milk. The mother waits patiently until the baby's mouth opens very wide, then moves the baby quickly onto her breast. The mother can gently compress her breast to get the milk flow started. Pulling her baby closer can also deepen the attachment. We see signs of better attachment. The baby's mouth is wide open. We see more of the areola above the baby's mouth than below. The baby's chin is touching the breast and though we cannot see it, her lower lip should be turned outward. Now her nipple is at normal shape compared to her nipple from when her baby was not attached well. Also compare the signs of attachment. Before, her baby's mouth was almost closed. An equal amount of areola was seen above and below the mouth. The baby's chin was just touching the breast and her lower lip was turned inward. Now, her mouth is wide open. More areola is visible above the baby's mouth than below. The baby's chin is deep in the breast. So buried that we cannot see the bottom lip. Though the new positioning may take time to learn, this mother now understands breastfeeding can be comfortable and the key steps to attaching her baby better. In addition to attaching the baby deeply, here are a few other suggestions that can help with nipple pain. The mother can hand express to bring her milk before putting the baby to her breast. She can improve the attachment by pulling the baby in closer with her forearm. Breast compressions help the baby to get more milk faster, which will shorten the feed and last breast milk is healing to the nipples. Let it dry on the nipples after feedings and keep them open to air. Sometimes nipples can be sore due to thrush. Check the baby's mouth for white patches on the inner cheeks and treat both mother and baby if found. If the mother is HIV infected, she should feed only from the healthy breast, not from a nipple that is cracked or bleeding. She can express and discard milk from the damaged breast until the nipple heals. The baby can then take both breasts again. Give the mother support and reassure her that painful nipples heal very quickly. When the baby is attached well. Have her return if the pain continues.

Mastitis,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/Mastitis_CB_D.mp4,"If a mother doesn't take care of a blocked duct, it can progress to a breast infection. The lump will become red, hot, swollen and painful and she'll feel ill often with a fever. If she has a very painful swollen lump, it may be an abscess and would need to be drained by a skilled clinician. In caring for a breast infection, be sure the baby is attaching deeply, then follow the four steps suggested for a blocked duct. First, breastfeed frequently, starting on the infected side. The milk is safe for the baby. Second, apply a warm wet cloth. Third, gently compress the breast and last, massage the breast gently. Remember the area is tender to touch. In a breast infection, the milk is not infected, only the breast tissue. Its still good for the baby. She needs to keep the milk flowing in the infected breast by feeding the baby or expressing milk frequently. If the mother is HIV infected though, she should feed only from the healthy breast, not from the infected breast. She can express and discard milk from the infected breast until her fever is gone.
The baby can then take both breasts again. Give the mother an antibiotic such as dicloxacillin. She can take paracetamol for the pain and fever. Advise her to return if there is
no improvement after one day of treatment. If she has a breast infection, she is ill, she shouldn't work. She should stay in bed, drink plenty of fluids and keep her baby with her to feed often.

Improve supply of milk,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/Improve_Supply_of_Milk_CB.mp4,"If a mother thinks her baby is not getting enough milk, how can she increase her baby's intake? First improve the attachment. If the baby is attached only on the nipple, the baby gets very little milk; but, when he takes more of the breast in his mouth, milk comes easily. This deep attachment enables the baby to remove more milk from the breast which then stimulates the breast to make more milk enough for the baby's needs. Babies may not be well attached but because the mother makes abundant milk at first, babies may thrive over a few months though. If the baby is not well attached, he won't take all the milk the mother is making and her supply will decrease. Her baby will start to be restless at the breast, pulling or slapping and may reject the breast entirely or feed for very short periods of time because the flow of milk is not meeting his needs. To prevent that, observe the mother breastfeeding and guide her to improve the attachment right from the start when the baby is a newborn. Next, compress the breast. Compressing the breast will improve the flow of milk and keep the baby drinking. If the baby falls asleep quickly at the breast, compressing will start the milk to flow. The baby will start to swallow and wake up. As the milk comes, have the mother press her breast between her thumb and fingers as far back from the nipple as is comfortable. Pressure should be firm but not painful. Suggest she compress while the baby is sucking and rest while the baby is resting. If the baby is drinking well, there is no need to compress. And last, feed the baby often and well. In the early days after birth the baby will be hungry often, at least ten times between one sunrise and the next. A newborns stomach is small and breast milk is quickly digested. Encourage the mother to follow her baby's signals. He is able to tell her what he needs. Holding her baby skin to skin on her chest to start a feeding helps her baby to calm and organize himself. Teach the mother to respond to her baby's hunger signals. Sucking motions of his lips, bringing her hand to his mouth and turning his head from side to side. Encourage her to feed her baby whenever she sees his feeding signals day and night. There is no need to time how long the baby feeds or remember which breast he was last on. Some babies are fast feeders and others are slow. The baby will know when the flow on one breast has slowed and he is ready for the other side. As the flow of milk slows, the baby comes off the breast on his own. The mother holds her baby to her chest. As she patiently waits, her baby starts to signal his hunger. He was interested in going back on the breast twice more, full at last, the baby falls asleep and drops off the breast. At times the baby may suddenly want more milk than before. This is normal. It means the baby is growing and so is his hunger. As the mother follows her baby signals she will feed him more often and naturally increase her supply of milk. Do not give the baby water, sweetened water, tea, honey, breast milk substitutes or anything else. They can fill up the baby so he won't feed as much at the breast. This will reduce the mother's milk supply. They can also give the baby harmful germs and make him sick. Instead follow the baby's signals. Feed the baby often whenever she signals her hunger. After a few days of extra feeding as long as the baby is well attached and the mother is using compressions to make every feed effective, the mothers milk supply will grow to meet the baby's needs.

Show the family the baby's feeding cues, putting his fingers in his mouth and turning his head means he's hungry. Feed the baby whenever he's hungry, as much and as often as he wants, at least every 2 to 3 hours, day and night. Be sure the mother feels comfortable breastfeeding. If the baby is not well attached, show her how to improve the position and attachment of her baby. Advise that she give her baby only her milk for the first six months. No water, sweetened water, tea, honey, formula or anything else. Advise the family not to put anything on the baby's cord and keep it open to air. They should wash their hands before caring for the baby. There is no need to wash the baby every day, but they should keep his face and bottom clean. Talk about keeping the baby warm. Advise the way they dress him in an extra layer of clothing and a covering on his head. Recommend that the baby sleep on his back or his side, not on his belly. Keep the young baby away from smoke. If malaria is common, recommend using an insecticide treated bed net to prevent malaria in both the mother and baby. If the mother has HIV, be sure she gives her baby ARV medicine to protect him from becoming infected. Next, teach newborn danger signs - fast breathing, chest indrawing, the chest draws in with each breath, a cold body temperature the baby's belly and feet are cold compared to their own. A hot body temperature - the baby's body is hot to touch, not feeding the baby doesn't act hungry and may not wake up to feed. Lethargy, the baby only moves when stimulated. Convulsions, the baby may have unusual eye or mouth movements or repetitive jerking of the arms or legs.

The baby is drinking well, notice how his jaw drops and has a brief pause as he swallows. He is now able to coordinate suckling, swallowing and breathing. As the baby matures, his sucks will gradually become stronger and more regular, his attachment would be deeper and he will have the stamina for a full feed. The mother may feel him swallowing and her breast may feel softer after he feeds. With her baby held skin to skin, the mother can easily notice and respond to his hunger signals. She simply loosens the wrap and positions her baby near her nipple. She can also express her milk cup feed and tube feed while the baby is held closely.

Reassess,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/Reassess_CB.mp4,"Assess the baby morning, afternoon and night. Here are the three steps. First, talk to the mother. Ask her if she has noticed anything about her baby that concerns her. She is the key caretaker and a partner in the care of her baby. Second, examine the baby. Wash your hands, then do a basic exam. As you check the baby teach the mother key observations. Does the baby look well? Observe his activity. A well baby will be alert and active when awake. Show the mother examples of dangerous signs. An unwell baby may be sluggish or have convulsions. How is the baby breathing? A well baby breathes comfortably at a rate between 30 and 60 breaths per minute. An unwell baby may breathe too fast, have long pauses in his breathing, or have chest in drawing and sometimes a grunting sound. Observe the baby's color. A well baby will have pink lips and tongue. An unwell baby may have blue lips and tongue or jaundice, a yellow color on his palms or soles. Check the baby's abdomen. A well baby has a soft belly. If the belly is distended, the baby may have a problem. Check the baby's temperature. Show the mother how to feel the temperature of her baby's foot. If it's cold or hot, check the baby with a thermometer. Then zero the scale, weigh the baby and record it in the baby's chart. Third, evaluate how the baby is feeding. Find out how much milk the baby takes and how often he feeds in 24 hours, whether by breast, cup or feeding tube. Ask about the baby's stools he's feeding well. If the stools are yellow and frequent, four or more each day after the first week of life. Advise the mother that if she has any concerns about her baby, she should notify a health worker right away, day or night. Bring together the mother's observations with your own findings to discover small changes in the baby's condition quickly. Each time you check a baby, decide - is the baby well or is there a concern? Does he need closer attention or is he unwell and needs advanced care? From that decision comes action. Write your findings in the baby's record and communicate with your coworkers to keep all caregivers up to date on the baby's condition.

Express breastmilk,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/Express_Breastmilk_CB.mp4,"The mother should have clean hands to express her milk and a clean spoon or cup. To help her milk to flow, have the mother stimulate her breasts by gently massaging with light stroking or gentle circular motions around the whole breast. Seeing and hearing her baby also helps the milk flow. Now show her where to position her fingers. Placing a small piece of tape where her thumb and first finger should go will help her fingers find the right place, two finger widths from the nipple on opposite sides of the breast. Show her how to hold her hand in a c position. Then guide her where to place her hand and fingers on her breast. Her thumb is on one side, her first finger is directly opposite with the nipple in the center. Her other fingers support her breast. Placing your hand over hers, lets the mother feel the emotion and is a good way to teach her the technique of expressing. There are three steps - pressing back toward the chest wall, compressing the thumb and fingers together and then releasing. Where a mother places her thumb and fingers and how she presses will make a difference in her success at expressing her milk, especially early on. A look inside the mothers breast will show why. With her thumb and first finger on opposite sides of the breast, she presses back against the lobules to stimulate the milk to release into the ducts, then gently compresses her thumb and fingers together to move the milk into the ducts and releases. Again she presses back into the denser breast tissue, compresses a little tighter as milk flows almost to the areola and releases. She presses back and with a little tighter compression, the first few drops begin to come. Pressing back, compressing the thumb and fingers together and then releasing. Have her alternate breasts back and forth. It's easiest if she uses the right hand to express the right breast and the left hand to express the left. The other hand holds the spoon. The mother should not expect to see hardly any milk at first. She is just stimulating the milk to start to flow. As she repeats the steps, the colostrum starts to come. Have her move her fingers around the breast to clear all segments. This will help the breast to empty. Suggest she stroke her breast now and then to keep the milk flowing. She should express until the drops of milk stop flowing. To establish a good supply of milk, a mother should express every two to 3 hours throughout the day and night.

Feed with cup,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/Feed_with_Cup_CB.mp4,"When the small baby is awakening to a feed every two to 4 hours, try feeding him by cup. He is ready to cup feed if he can swallow milk without coughing, choking or turning blue. Help the mother recognize the baby's feeding signals. Eyes open, looking around, moving his mouth and his tongue. Feed the baby whenever he signals his hunger. Teach the mother to cup feed by first showing her the steps, then guiding her as she feeds her baby. Have her wash her hands, then pour the baby's measured volume of milk into a small cup. Next, have the mother wrap her baby and hold him in a nearly upright position on her lap. Her hand supports his head and neck. The mother rests the cup lightly
on the baby's lower lip. She then tips the cup until the milk reaches the top edge and lets the baby take the milk. A small baby needs to pace himself during cup feeding. Here he pauses. Now there's a burst of lapping and then another short pause. Keep the milk right at the rim of the cup and leave the cup in place, resting lightly on the baby's lower lip. Let the baby feed and watch for signs that he's had enough. Notice now the baby holds his hand up and then starts to fall asleep. Feedback and encouragement will help a mother become confident in feeding her baby. In this next example, again the milk is kept level with the rim of the cup, giving the baby a continuous supply of milk. The baby takes the milk at his own pace. To signal he's done the baby closes his mouth.

Insert NG tube,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/Insert_a_Nasogastric_Tube_CB_B.mp4,"The tube is passed through the nose, down the back of the throat and into the stomach. Take the time to talk with the mother about the procedure and the need for it. Reassure her that this is safe and will not hurt her baby. To start, gather the nasogastric tube, a 5 milliliter syringe, a feeding syringe, a marker, and a tape. A five or six French gastric tube is best for a small baby. Wash your hands well with soap and water. Next, measure the length of tube to be inserted. It goes from the tip of the nose to the earlobe to a point halfway between the tip of the breastbone and the umbilicus. Now put the end of the tube on the tip of the baby's nose. Stretch it to the earlobe, then to a point halfway between the tip of the breast bone and the umbilicus. Mark the length, lubricate the tip with expressed milk to ease the passage of the tube. Hold the baby's head still and flex his neck forward slightly. Gently insert the tube through the baby's nostril slowly and steadily. Aim to the back of the head until you've reached your mark. The tube is uncomfortable for the baby as it's inserted, but painless once it's in place. Now tape the tube, keeping your mark visible. Never force the tube if it doesn't slide easily, stop and try the other nostril. Very rarely, the tube may try to go into the trachea leading to the lungs. This is rare but serious. A feeding that goes into the lungs can possibly be fatal. Now check for correct placement. Connect the syringe to the tube. Pull back on the syringe and look for small amounts of digested milk or gastric fluid in the tube. If there is no fluid in the tube, remove it and repeat the procedure. Tape the tube securely once you've confirmed that it's in the right place, be sure the tape sticks to the tube to avoid it sliding around beneath the tape. Your mark should be visible near the nose.

Transition to breastfeeding,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/Transition_to_Exclusive_Breastfeeding_CB.mp4,"Teach the mother to recognize her baby's feeding signals. At first, the baby may only awaken or stir before feedings. As the baby matures, his feeding signals will become more obvious. Have the mother put her baby to her breast even briefly when he signals his hunger. Show her how to position her baby securely so that his head and body are supported. Teach her to express drops of milk into her baby's mouth. At first, he may only swallow once or twice and then fall asleep. If he chokes or turns blue, he's not yet ready to breastfeed. After practice time at the breast, have the mother give the baby his full volume of milk by cup or feeding tube. At this stage, he'll receive almost all his milk this way and very little from the breast. By getting his feeding needs met so easily, he'll grow faster. As the baby matures he'll stay awake longer at the breast and learn to suckle. Suckling helps develop his feeding skills and stimulates the mother's milk production. Once he suckles well, teach the mother how to attach her baby. Have her rub her nipple on his lips and drip milk into his mouth. Be patient. When he opens wide, have her bring him directly onto her breast. Notice the signs of attachment. His mouth is wide open, his chin touches the breast and his cheeks are rounded. More areola is seen above the baby's mouth than below. His jaw drops as he drinks and he pauses briefly as he swallows. Now he's learned to coordinate sucking, swallowing and breathing to breastfeed effectively. Feeding is hard work for a small baby. Watch for signs that the baby has had enough. He may bat at the breast, pull off, cry or fall asleep. Then let him rest skin to skin between the mother's breasts. As the baby matures, his breastfeeding skills will improve. His sucks will become long, strong and regular and his jaw will drop low as he swallows. The baby will learn to take rest, breaks and pace himself. It's important for the mother to build up a generous supply of milk. The flow of milk will be easier for the small baby to access. After her baby feeds, advise the mother to express her milk to keep her supply up. Her breast should feel soft when she's removed enough milk. Gradually increase breastfeeding with less and less supplementation. As a guide, if the baby does not attach well at the breast, give him a full feed by feeding tube or cup. If he attaches well but has frequent long pauses or feeds for less than ten minutes, give half
the feed by cup or feeding tube. If the baby feeds well by breast for more than 15 minutes, he does not need extra feeding. At this point, the mother can very gradually reduce
the number of times she expresses. Make sure the baby's weight gain continues once he is only breastfeeding, that he is content after feeds, and that he has frequent yellow stools, four or more each day.

Advise about ongoing care,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/Advise_about_Ongoing_Care_CB.mp4,"After the baby is discharged home, see him twice a week until he reaches two kilos, then once a week until he is two and a half kilos. Bring a weighing scale, soap, a thermometer, a timepiece, danger sign visual aids and the baby's records. First, wash your hands. Remind the family that anyone who touches the baby wash their hands with soap and water first, especially before feeding, after cleaning his stools and whenever their hands are soiled. Find out how the mother and family are doing now that the baby is home. Ask if there is anything about the baby that concerns them. Throughout the visit, teach the family how to care for and protect their young baby. Have them keep the baby warm in continuous skin to skin contact. Teach the mother to check a baby's feet for warmth at each feed. Advise the family to clean the baby with a cloth when needed, but don't chill him with a bath. Encourage family members to have eye contact and to talk to their baby. Love and attention help the baby's emotional and social development. Now decide if the baby is feeding well. Each small baby progresses along his own path to full breastfeeding. Decide at each visit if the baby is feeding well and making progress. The baby is feeding well if he is content between feeds, he is gaining weight and his stools are yellow and frequent, four or more each day. Next, decide if the baby is healthy. As you check the baby, teach the family the seven danger signs. The first thing to do is to go immediately to the health center. A danger sign is practically saying the baby could die at home, so they have to run with any sign of alarm. Decide if the baby is gaining weight. Weigh the baby, then plot the weight on his growth chart. Show the family the baby's progress. After the first week of life, when some weight loss is normal, the baby should gradually gain weight.

Assess for danger signs,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/Assess_for_Danger_Signs_CB.mp4,"Poor feeding is the first danger sign. The baby with poor feeding sucks less or poorly, or not at all. He may not open his mouth when offered the breast or he doesn't act hungry. He may not wake up to feed or he does not stay awake long enough to empty the breast. Here we compare a healthy baby. She is alert and suckles well at the breast.
Lethargy is the second danger sign. Observe the baby's movements. A baby with lethargy will have less energy than normal and appear sluggish and drowsy. Try to wake the baby. Clap or rub a foot. Notice that the baby with lethargy doesn't wake up easily. Here we compare a normal sleeping baby. When we try to wake him, even just by clapping, he reacts normally by fussing and crying and then he stays awake. The baby with lethargy only moves when aroused or he doesn't move at all. Lethargy and poor feeding often overlap. Convulsions are the third danger sign. Features of convulsions in a newborn are often subtle such as a staring look, blinking of eyelids and unusual movement of the lips. Convulsions can also be more obvious. In this baby, we see tight flexing of his feet and repetitive jerking of his arm. A cold body temperature is the fourth danger sign. Compare the baby's body temperature to your own. If the baby's feet and belly are cold, the baby is too cold and may be very sick. A thermometer measuring less than
35.5 degrees is dangerously low. Warm the baby quickly through skin to skin contact on the mother's chest and cover them with blankets. If after the baby is warmer, he still
looks unwell, this is a danger sign. A hot body temperature is the fifth danger sign. The baby's body will feel hot to touch compared to your own body. The mother may report that the baby's mouth is hot on her breast. The face and body may look flushed. A temperature more than 37.5 degrees is too high. Cool the baby off by removing his clothes for ten minutes. If the baby is still too hot or looks unwell, this is a danger sign. Chest indrawing is the sixth danger sign. Watch the baby's chest and abdomen closely. Notice as the baby draws a breath, his chest draws in and the belly appears to move out. Fast breathing is the seventh danger sign. To determine if a baby is breathing too fast, count breaths for a full minute when the baby is quiet, more than 60 is too fast. Count again to be sure. Babies with breathing problems can have fast breathing or chest in drawing and often both signs occur together. Here we compare a baby with normal breathing to a baby with both fast breathing and chest in drawing, nasal flaring and grunting, a sound heard on the outer breath can also be present in a baby with severe breathing problems.

Give antibiotics,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/Give_Anitbiotics_CB.mp4,"Wash your hands, then gather your supplies. Gentamycin, ampicillin and sterile water for injection, a sterile syringe and needle for mixing the ampicillin, cotton balls and two smaller sterile needles and syringes to give the injections. Check that the medicines have not expired. Gentamicin is available in several strengths. Be sure to double check the concentration before you draw up the dose. There is no need to dilute any of the products. The 80 milligrams per 2ml concentration is preferred. The smaller volume is less painful for the baby. The dosage chart shows that our 3.2 kilo baby needs 0.4ml of this concentration. A 1ml syringe, will help your accuracy with the small dose. Now draw up the medicine. First, draw air into the syringe equal to the dose you need. Then inject the air into the vial. Turn it upside down, keeping the tip of the needle in the fluid.
If you've drawn bubbles into the syringe, push the plunger back and forth to return them to the vial. Drying up your dose is easy because the air you added to the vial counteracts the vacuum. Now tap the syringe to let any remaining bubbles rise to the top and gently push the plunger to clear them. Check that you have the right dose of 0.4ml. Cap the needle with the one handed method to avoid a finger prick. If you are using an ampule instead of a vial, wrap the neck in gauze to protect your hand and snap off the top. Put the needle carefully into the opening to draw up the medicine. Now prepare ampicillin. Follow the directions on the bottle to prepare the medicine. Draw up 1.8ml of sterile water and add it to the 500 milligrams bottle of ampicillin. Shake the bottle to mix the powder and water until it's completely dissolved. The baby will need 0.6ml ampicillin. Draw 0.6ml of air into the syringe, then inject it into the vial. Turn it upside down, keeping the needle in the fluid. Draw up your dose. Notice the bubbles being returned back to the vial before removing the syringe. Now tap the syringe to clear the remaining bubbles and gently push the plunger to remove the air. There's your dose of 0.6ml. The sick baby needs his first dose of gentamicin. Let the mother know that the medicine will help her baby get well. Show her you'll be giving it in the baby's upper outer thigh, the safest place to give an IM injection in a baby. Show the mother how to hold her baby still. Her arm goes across her baby's upper body holding his arms and her hand holds the baby's leg. Breastfeeding will comfort the baby during the injection. Clean the skin with clean water. Put a second cotton ball close by. Hold the baby's thigh firmly throughout the injection. Then with one quick motion insert the needle at a 90 degree angle straight into the outer thigh muscle. Inject steadily, withdraw the needle and apply gentle pressure with a cotton ball. The needle goes safely into the sharps container.

Wrap Designs for Skin-to-Skin Care,https://rhlaiservice2.blob.core.windows.net/hmbs-enc2/wrap_designs.mp4,"Wrap designs for skin to skin care. There are many ways to make a wrap to carry the baby skin to skin from a length of locally available cloth to a custom made pouch. All wraps work well as long as the baby is held securely between the mother's breasts, it supports the baby's head tilted up slightly to allow him to breathe freely and the wrap lets the mother move about easily with both hands free. This video shows examples of several wraps used around the world. This mother uses a sari 5 meters long. Both the length and the width are folded in half. The mother sits on the bed and arranges the cloth first. She throws one long end on one side and the other long end on the other side, crossing them over behind her. The middle of the cloth is fully opened on her lap. She positions her baby between her breasts, then pulls up the front of the cloth over the baby and up close under her arms. She brings the end of the saree forwards, tightening them as she goes. She tightens them one last time, then ties them in a knot onto her baby's bottom. The loose ends are tucked under the bottom edge of the wrap. She pulls the cloth up under her arms. Now she tilts the baby's head up so he can breathe freely and adjusts the top edge of the wrap to hold his head in place. This wrap is made from a tube of stretchy fabric such as spandex or even an old stretchy t shirt. The mother pulls the front down and positions her baby on her chest with his legs below her breast and his arms above. The wrap is pulled up over her baby. The snugness of the stretchy wrap gives good support. The baby's head is tilted up and the wrap is adjusted to support his head. Mothers can care for their babies easily within the stretchy wrap. The wrap holds the baby close as the mother feeds him, expresses her milk or even takes the baby's temperature. This mother uses her wool shawl. She sits on the edge of the bed with her shawl stretched out behind her. She positions her baby on her chest with his arms above and his legs below her breasts. Then, placing one end of the shawl over her baby, she reaches around to pick up the other side of the shawl. She pulls it around firmly, tightens it and then wraps it around her back. Holding it firm, she pulls the cloth close and tucks it into the top edge of the wrap. The mother now tilts the baby's head up and adjusts the upper edge of the cloth to support the baby's head. She then ties her cloth around her waist under the baby's bottom so he doesn't slip down and puts on an open rope over top. This wrap is made from a long piece of soft cloth that has two straps cut on each side of a centerpiece. The mother places the top straps temporarily on her shoulders. She then wraps the bottom straps around her back, crosses them and brings them to the front to tie them under her breasts. She slips her baby into the loose front of the wrap, keeping his legs below her breast and his arms above. The upper straps are now slipped under her arms, crossed in back and brought over the top of her shoulders. She tightens the straps and ties them one on each side of her baby. The ties help to support the baby's head position. She adjusts the top edge of the cloth to keep the baby's head tilted up slightly so he can breathe freely. This sturdy and comfortable wrap is specially designed for skin to skin care. The mother puts the shorter straps on first. She then takes the lower straps, crosses them in the back and ties them in the front. She opens the front, then places the baby on her chest with his legs below and arms above her breasts. She puts the shoulder straps back on and adjusts the top of the wrap to support her baby's head. Then, supporting the baby with one hand, she reaches around for the side straps. She crosses the straps, tightens them and ties them in front under her baby's bottom. This keeps the baby securely in place. To breastfeed her baby while in skin to skin care, she loosens the side straps, takes one arm out of the wrap and moves her baby to her breast. To remove her baby from the wrap, she slips off the straps, supports his chin and head with one hand and with the other hand reaches inside, under her baby's bottom and lifts him from the wrap. This mother uses a long, narrow, lightweight cloth. She positions the baby first, his arms above and legs below her breasts. She places a blanket at the baby's back to keep him warm, then pulls the cloth up around the baby and brings the end around to her back. She tightens the cloth and crosses the ends in the back. The ends are brought around to the front, tied below the baby's bottom and tucked under the wrap. The mother tilts the baby's head up and adjusts the cloth to support it. Remember, the wrap for skin to skin contact holds the baby securely on the mother's chest. It supports the baby's head tilted up slightly to allow him to breathe freely. The mother or family members are able to move about easily with both hands free.
